# Simple Instructions for the To-Do App Assessment

## Create a Form to Add Task

### Create input fields

- [ ] Name (text input)
- [ ] Description (text area)
- [ ] Due Date (date picker)
- [ ] Assigned To (text input)
- [ ] Status (dropdown with options: in-progress, completed, review)

### Validate Form Inputs

- [ ] Check that all fields are filled in before submission.
- [ ] Show an error message if any field is empty or invalid (e.g., "Name cannot be empty").
- [ ] When a new task is added, generate a unique ID for it (e.g., using Date.now() or an incrementing number).

### Save Tasks

- [ ] Store tasks as objects (e.g., { id, name, description, dueDate, assignedTo, status }) in an array.
- [ ] Save this array in localStorage to keep tasks even when the page is refreshed.

### Display Tasks on the Page

- [ ] Loop through the saved tasks and show each task on the page.
- [ ] Display these details: Name, Description, Due Date, Assigned To, Status.

### Edit and Remove Tasks

- [ ] Add buttons for Edit and Delete next to each task.
- [ ] Edit: Allow the user to change task details in the form.
- [ ] Delete: Remove the task from the array and update the display.

 ### Sort Tasks by Status
- [ ] Add a button or dropdown to sort tasks by their status (in-progress, completed, review).
- [ ] Rearrange the displayed tasks accordingly.
